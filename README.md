> # <p align="center">Project Ideas and Case Studies for Gaining Practical Experience in Blockchain Technologies</p>

###### To help students from IITU Almaty Kazakhstan gain maximum experience and skills in blockchain technology, particularly in Solidity, smart contracts, MetaMask, and decentralized applications (DApps), it's essential to engage them with hands-on projects and real-world case studies. Below are several project ideas ranging from beginner to advanced levels, along with case studies that address real-world problems using modern and robust blockchain technologies.

# Beginner-Level Projects


<div style="background-color: green; color: white;">1. Hello World Smart Contract</div>

---

- **Objective**:
  - Introduce students from IITU Almaty Kazakhstan to Solidity syntax and the basics of smart contract development.
- **Description**:
  - Create a simple smart contract that stores a greeting message and allows users to read or update it.
- **Technologies**:

  - [`Solidity`](https://solidity-by-example.org/hello-world/): Programming language for writing smart contracts.

  ```javascript
  pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

  contract HelloWorld {
  string public greet = "Hello World!";
  }
  ```

  - [`Remix IDE`](https://remix.ethereum.org/): Browser-based IDE for writing and testing contracts.
  - [`MetaMask`](https://portfolio.metamask.io/): Ethereum wallet for interacting with DApps.

- **Skills Gained**:
  - Understanding Solidity basics.
  - Deploying contracts on a local blockchain.
  - Interacting with contracts via MetaMask.

  - [`Solidity`](https://solidity-by-example.org/hello-world/): Programming language for writing smart contracts.

  ```javascript
  pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

  contract HelloWorld {
      string public greet = "Hello World!";
  }
  ```

  - [`MetaMask`](https://portfolio.metamask.io/)

- Skills Gained:
  - Understanding token standards.
  - Using inheritance and libraries in Solidity.

- **Technologies**:

  - [`Solidity`](https://solidity-by-example.org/hello-world/): Programming language for writing smart contracts.

  ```javascript
  pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

  contract HelloWorld {
      string public greet = "Hello World!";
  }
  ```
